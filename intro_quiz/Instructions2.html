<p>
  In this study, employers and workers act in a labor market with six employers and six workers.
  This study consists of <strong>10 periods</strong> in total.
  Each period will be identical.
  Every period consists of two parts: <strong>(1) The hiring phase and (2) the work phase</strong>.
</p>

<h3>Hiring Phase</h3>

<p>
  The hiring phase consists of several steps in which employers and workers interact to form contracts.
  That is, employers can make contract offers to workers and workers can decide whether to accept a contract offer.
</p>

<h4>Employer makes contract offers</h4>

<p>
  In each period, employers start with reviewing the workers. Information about workers includes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>each worker's color alias, and</li>
  <li>each worker's skill level (as described in more detail below).</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Then, each employer has to decide whether to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Make</strong> a contract offer <strong>to one worker</strong> from the six potential workers on the labor market, or</li>
  <li><strong>Not make</strong> any contract offer in that period.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  A contract offer includes the following information about what will be offered by the employer to the worker in that
  period:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>a <strong>salary</strong> between 1 and 1500 points, and</li>
  <li>whether or not <strong>training</strong> will be provided (as discussed in more detail below).</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Importantly, employers <strong>must</strong> fulfill the salary and training specified in the contract, if the contract offer is
  accepted by a worker.
</p>

<h4>Workers decide whether to accept a contract offer</h4>
<p>
  Next, workers will be provided with a list of all contract offers they received in this period. It is possible that a worker does not receive any offer, receives one offer, or receives multiple offers.
</p>

<p>
  Each worker has to decide whether to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Accept one</strong> of the contract offers, or</li>
  <li><strong>Decline all</strong> contract offers.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Employers and workers that form a contract will be matched for the subsequent work phase of the period.
</p>

<h4>Unmatched employers and workers</h4>
<p>
  Employers and workers that do not form a contract remain on the labor market.
</p>

<p>
  Employers can decide to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>select a <strong>different worker</strong> to make a contract offer to, or</li>
  <li><strong>not make</strong> an offer for that period.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Importantly, an employer cannot make an offer to a worker that has already rejected a contract offer from this
  employer in this period. That means, if the worker rejects the offer, the employer can make an offer to one of the
  other workers he/she has not attempted to hire yet and that are still available on the market but cannot make more
  than one offer to the same worker in the same period.
</p>

<p>
  The process will continue until either all employers and workers form contracts and are matched or until the remaining
  (unmatched) employers and workers cannot agree on a contract. In case the remaining employers and workers cannot agree
  on a contract, they will miss out on the work phase for this period and only receive the initial endowment as payment
  for that period (described below).
