<p>
  Workers begin each period with an initial endowment of {{ employee_endowment }} points.
</p>
<p>
  If a worker <strong>does not</strong> accept any contracts, he/she will only receive the endowment in this period.
</p>
<p>
  If a worker <strong>accepts a contract</strong>, the worker receives the following revenues and incurs the following
  costs:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>He/she will receive the salary specified in the contract.</li>
  <li>
    Additionally, he/she will have to make a decision about his/her effort and will incur a <strong>cost</strong>
    based on the level of effort selected.
    This cost is subtracted from the worker's earnings for the period.
    The cost of effort table is provided again below:
  </li>
</ul>
{{ include '_tables/intro_quiz/effort.html' }}

<p>
  So, if a worker <strong>does not accept</strong> any contract, the worker's earnings for this period are:
</p>
<p>
  <pre>Worker earnings for the period = {{ employee_endowment }} (initial endowment)</pre>
</p>

<p>
  If a worker <strong>accepts</strong> a contract, the worker's earnings for this period are:
</p>
<p>
  <pre>Worker earnings for the period = {{ employee_endowment }} (initial endowment) + salary â€“ cost of effort</pre>
</p>
