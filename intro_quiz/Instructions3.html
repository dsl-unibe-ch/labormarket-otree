<h3>Work Phase</h3>
<p>
  Employers and workers that form a contract in the hiring phase continue to the work phase. In this phase, workers
  decide how much effort, from level 1 to 10, to exert for the employer.
</p>

<h4>Worker costs based on worker effort level</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Effort is costly to the worker, such that higher effort levels chosen by the worker increase the worker's costs.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The table below shows the different effort levels and the corresponding costs to the worker
</p>

<h4>Employer revenue based on a worker's effort level and a worker's skill level</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Employer revenue depends on both a worker's chosen effort level and a worker's skill level.
  </li>
  <li>
    A worker's skill level determines a worker's productivity. The higher a worker's skill level, the higher the
    worker's productivity and thus the higher the employer's revenues, for any given effort level. Specifically:
    Employer revenue = worker effort level Ã— worker productivity. For example, if a worker with skill level 1 chooses
    effort level 4, employer revenue = 100 x 4 = 400, but if a worker with skill level 5 chooses effort level 4,
    employer revenue = 242 x 4 = 968.
  </li>
  <li>
    As you can see from the table below, for every worker's skill level, the higher the effort level the worker chooses,
    the higher the employer's revenues. For example, if a worker with a skill level of 1 chooses effort level 4,
    employer revenue = 100 x 4 = 400, but if a worker with a skill level of 1 chooses effort level 8, employer
    revenue = 100 x 8 = 800.
  </li>
  <li>
    A worker's skill level can be increased if the worker receives training (as discussed below).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The table below shows employer revenue for each combination of skill and effort level:

<p>
  After the worker has made their effort decision, both the employer and worker will be informed about their earnings
  for the period.
</p>

<h3>Next Period</h3>

<p>
  The next period begins again with the hiring phase, meaning that employers can again offer contracts to all six
  workers, workers review contract offers, and so on.
