<h4>Training and worker skill level</h4>

<p>
  As we explained above, an employer can offer a worker a contract that
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>does not provide training</strong>, or</li>
  <li><strong>provides training</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Contract <em>without</em> Training</h5>

<p>
  In the work phase of the current period, the worker chooses the effort level as described above.
</p>
<p>
  If a contract does not provide training, the worker's skill level <strong>will not change</strong>. That is,
  the worker's skill level in the subsequent period will remain equal to his/her skill level in the current period.
</p>
<p>
  In this case, the employer does not incur any costs related to training. That means, the employer will receive
  the full amount of revenue resulting from the worker's skill level and the effort level chosen by the worker.
  Likewise, there is no direct cost of training for the employer.
</p>

<h5>Contract <em>with</em> Training</h5>

<p>
  In the work phase of the current period, the worker chooses the effort level as described above.
</p>
<p>
  If an employer offers a contract that provides training, the <strong>training will increase the worker's
  skill level by 1 in all <em>future</em> period(s)</strong> but the
  <strong>worker's skill level will <em>not</em> change in the <em>current</em> period</strong>.
  For example, if a worker has a skill level of 1 (Productivity = 100) and accepts a contract with training,
  their skill level will then be 2 (Productivity = 140) in the <strong>next period</strong>.
  <strong>Increases</strong> in worker skill level are <strong>permanent</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>A worker does not incur any costs for training</strong> when accepting a contract offer that offers training.
</p>
<p>
  However, like in the real world, <strong>an employer incurs costs when offering training</strong> to a worker.
  There are two types of costs for the employer:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Direct cost of training:<br/>
    The employer will incur a direct training cost of <strong>50 points</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Reduced worker productivity:<br/>
    When training is provided, the worker's productivity <strong>will be halved during the training period</strong>,
    reducing the employer's revenue for that period. Specifically, for any combination of a worker's skill level
    and chosen effort level, the employer will only receive <strong>half</strong> of the revenue that is generated
    by this combination. For example, if a worker has a skill level of 1 and chooses an effort level of 5,
    the employer will not receive the revenue of 500 displayed in the table above, but only half of this revenue
    (500/2 = 250).
  </li>
</ul>
