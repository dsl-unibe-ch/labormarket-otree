  Employers begin each period with an initial endowment of {{ manager_endowment }} points.
</p>

<h3>Employer does not hire any worker</h3>
<p>
  If an employer <strong>does not</strong> hire any worker in a period, he/she will only receive the endowment in
  this period.
  So, if <strong>the employer does not offer any contracts or no worker accepts any of the employer's
  contract offers</strong>, the employer's earnings for this period are:
</p>
<p>
  <pre>
    Employer earnings for the period<br/>
    = {{ manager_endowment }} (initial endowment)
  </pre>
</p>

<h3>Employer hires and does not offer training</h3>
<p>
  If a worker <strong>accepts</strong> a contract offer of an employer that <strong>does not include</strong> training,
  the employer receives the following revenues and incurs the following costs:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Total revenue based on the hired worker's productivity (determined by his/her skill level) and the effort level
    the worker chooses in this period. Specifically,<br/>
    <pre>Employer revenue = worker effort level × worker productivity</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Total costs based on the amount of salary paid to the hired worker.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So, if a worker accepts a contract that does not include training, the employer's earnings for this period are:</p>
<p>
  <pre>
    Employer earnings for the period<br/>
    = {{ manager_endowment }} (initial endowment)<br/>
    + worker effort level x worker productivity (employer revenue)<br/>
    – salary paid to worker
  </pre>
</p>

<h3>Employer hires and does offer training</h3>
<p>
  If a worker <strong>accepts</strong> a contract offer of an employer that <strong>does include</strong> training,
  the employer receives the following revenues and incurs the following costs:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Total revenue equals <strong>half of the revenue</strong> based on the hired worker's productivity
    (determined by his/her skill level) and the effort level the worker chooses in this period. Specifically,<br/>
    <pre>Employer revenue = 0.5 × worker effort level × worker productivity</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Total costs equal the direct cost of 50 points for the training and the salary paid to the hired worker.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  So, if a worker accepts a contract that <strong>does include</strong> training, the employer's earnings 
  for this period are:
</p>
<p>
  <pre>
    Employer earnings for the period
    = {{ manager_endowment }} (initial endowment)
    + 0.5 × [worker effort level × worker productivity] (employer revenue)
    – 50 (direct training costs)
    – salary paid to worker
  </pre>
</p>
