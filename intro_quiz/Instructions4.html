<h3>Worker Skill Level and Training</h3>

<h4>Worker skill levels, productivity and employer revenue</h4>

<p>
  Recall that an employer's revenue depends on both the worker's chosen effort level and the worker's skill level:
</p>
<p>
  The <strong>higher the worker's skill level</strong>, the <strong>higher the employer's revenue</strong> for any
  level of worker's effort. This is because a higher worker's skill level is associated with a higher worker's
  productivity.
</p>
<p>
  However, as a worker's skill level increases, the <strong>additional worker's productivity and employer's
  revenue</strong> gained from each increase in skill becomes <strong>smaller</strong>. {{ example }}
