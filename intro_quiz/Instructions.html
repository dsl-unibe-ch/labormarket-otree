<p>
  Please review the instructions below.
  After reviewing all of the instructions, you will be required to pass a brief comprehension quiz.
  You must pass the comprehension quiz to continue with the study.
</p>

<h3>Study Overview</h3>

<p>The study is broken into three parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    In the first part, you will learn about the simulation rules, take a quiz on the simulation rules, and preview the simulation.
  </li>
  <li>
    The second part of the study is the simulation.
    In the simulation, you will assume the role of either an employer or employee.
    Employers make decisions about hiring, paying, and training employees.
    Employees decide which employer to work for and how much effort to exert for that employer.
    The decisions you make in the simulation will determine the amount of compensation you will receive.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the final part of the study, you will review your earnings from the simulation and answer a few demographic questions.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Simulation Overview</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    In the simulation, participants will be randomly divided into either employers or employees.
    Participants will stay in the same role for the entirety of the simulation.
    Each session will have 6 employers and 6 employees.
  </li>
  <li>
    The simulation is comprised of {{ session.config.max_rounds }} rounds.
    Each round has a hiring phase and a work phase, described below.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Hiring Phase</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    During the hiring phase, employers can make contract offers to employees and employees can decide which contract offers to accept.
  </li>
  <li>
    At the beginning of the hiring phase, employers review the available employees, including the employee’s study ID numbers and skill level (discussed more below), and select one employee to make a contract offer to.
    The contract offer will specify the number of units the employee will receive for the round and whether training (discussed below) will be provided.
    Regardless of the employee’s decisions in the work phase, the employer must pay the amount specified in the contract and provide training if it is offered.
  </li>
  <li>
    Next, employees will receive a list of all contract offers they received.
    It is possible employees will receive 1 offer, no offers, or multiple offers.
    Employees may select one of the contract offers to accept or they can decline all offers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Employers and employees that contract successfully will be matched for the subsequent work phase of the round. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Employers and employees that do not contract successfully repeat the offer and acceptance process until all employers and employees are matched.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the event the last remaining employer and employee cannot successfully agree on a contract, they will miss out on the work phase and only receive their endowment for the round.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Work Phase</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Employers and employees that successfully contract in the hiring phase continue to the work phase.
    In this phase, employees decide how much effort, from 1 to 10, to exert for the employer.
    Effort is costly to the employee and the amount of effort exerted directly impacts the amount of pay the employer receives.
  </li>
  <li>
    The table below shows the different levels of effort the employee can exert and how much that effort level will cost:
    {{ include '_tables/effort.html' }}
  </li>
  <li>
    Employers receive revenue based on the skill level of the employee and the level of effort selected. The amount of revenue received by the employer for each skill and effort level is shown below:
    {{ include '_tables/revenue.html' }}
  </li>
  <li>
    After the employee has made their effort decision, both the employer and employee will receive a summary of their earnings for the round. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Prior to the beginning of the next round, employers and employees should write down the study ID of the person they just contracted with so that they can either make sure to work with that participant again in the next round or avoid them, if they would like.
  </li>
  <li>
    The next round begins again with the hiring phase. There are ten rounds in the experiment and the amount of pay you will receive is based on the total experimental units earned across all {{ session.config.max_rounds }} rounds.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Training and Employee Skill Level</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    The amount of revenue an employer receives for each level of effort exerted by an employee is determined by the employee’s skill level.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each skill level is associated with a productivity multiplier that increases the amount of revenue the employer receives for each level of employee effort.
  </li>
  <li>
    The productivity multiplier increases as skill level increases, but the amount of the increase gets smaller for higher skill levels.
    For example, moving from skill level 1 to skill level 2 increases productivity from 1.00 to 1.40 (0.40 increase), but going from skill level 5 to skill level 6 only increases productivity from 2.42 to 2.70 (0.28 increase).
  </li>
  <li>
    The only way for an employee’s skill level to increase is if they contract with an employer that provides training. If the employee accepts a contract with training, their skill level will increase by 1 for in the next round and their productivity multiplier will increase as well.
  </li>
  <li>
    When an employee accepts a contract with training, their experience and earnings in the work phase of the round will be unchanged. They will still decide how much effort to exert and earn the amount of experimental units specified in the accepted contract.
  </li>
  <li>
    However, providing training is very costly to employers.
    To provide employee training, employers must pay 5 units.
    Additionally, the amount of revenue received for employee effort is half for any round in which training is provided.
    For example, if an employer would have made 100 units for a given employee skill level and effort, they will only receive 50 units if they provide training in that round.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Employee Pay</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Employees begin each round with a 20 unit endowment.
    If they do not accept any contracts or exert any effort, they will still receive this endowment.
  </li>
  <li>
    If employees accept a contract, they will receive the number of units specified in the contract.
  </li>
  <li>
    However, to exert more than minimal effort, employees will incur a cost based on the level of effort selected.
    This cost is subtracted from the employee’s earnings for the round.
    The cost of effort table is provided again below:
    {{ include '_tables/effort.html' }}
  </li>
  <li>
    So employee pay is determined based on the formula below:<br>
    <em>Employee pay = 20 + wage – cost of effort</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    Thus, if an employee received a wage of 20 and chose effort level 5 (cost = 10 units), their earnings for the round would be 30 (20 unit endowment + 20 unit wage – 10 unit cost of effort)
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Employer Pay</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Employers begin each round with a 50 unit endowment.
    As with employees, if employers do not hire any employees, they will still receive this endowment.
  </li>
  <li>
    Employers receive revenue based on the contracted employee’s skill level and chosen effort level.
    Specifically, employers receive revenue based on the formula below:<br>
    <em>Employer revenue = effort level &times; productivity multiplier &times; 10</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    Employer pay is reduced by the amount of wages paid to the contracted employee.
  </li>
  <li>
    Employer pay is also reduced if training is offered to the employee.
    If training is offered, the employer incurs two costs.
    <ul>
      <li>
        First, the employer must pay a 5 unit direct training cost.
      </li>
      <li>
        Second, the amount of revenue received from the employee is halved during the training round.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Example 1:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If training is not offered and an employee with a skill level of 2 (production multiplier = 1.40) exerts level 5 effort, the employer’s revenue would be 70 
(5 effort &times; 1.40 productivity &times; 10)
  </li>
  <li>
    If the employer offered the employee a wage of 30, their net pay for the round would then be 90 units (50 endowment + 70 revenue – 30 wage)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Example 2:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The same facts as Example 1, but training IS offered.
  </li>
  <li>
    Employer revenue would be 35 units (5 effort x 1.40 productivity x 10 x 1/2, due to training)
  </li>
  <li>
    Employer net pay would then be 55 units (50 endowment + 35 revenue – 30 wage)
  </li>
</ul>
