<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
  In this study, some of you will act as <strong>workers</strong> and some of you will act as
  <strong>employers</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  If you are an employer, you will be responsible for hiring a worker to work for you.
  If you are a worker, you will decide which employer to work for and how much effort to exert for that employer.
</p>
<p>
  You are assigned to the role of
  {{ if player.role == "Employee" }}
    a <strong>Worker</strong>.
  {{ else }}
    an <strong>Employer</strong>.
  {{ endif }}
  You will keep this role throughout the entire study.
  All other participants in this session will also keep their roles throughout the entire study.
</p>
<p>
  The decisions you and the other participants make will determine your compensation, which will be first provided in
  points. At the end of today's session, <strong>earned points will be converted into cash</strong> at the rate of
  $0.25 for every 100 points earned.
</p>
<p>
  Your participation will be completed entirely on the computer, and your roles will be completely anonymous.
  That is, you will never know the role of any other person in this room, and no one will know your role.
  You will only be identified by a randomly assigned color "alias" in the experiment.
  For example, in the experiment you might be known as "aquamarine."
</p>
<p>
  This study consists of 10 periods.
  After finishing all periods, you will complete a questionnaire about your experience in the study.
  Then, you will be asked to provide demographic information.
  Your responses to all these questions will be anonymous.
